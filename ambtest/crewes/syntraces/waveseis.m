function [w,tw]=waveseis(s,t,fsmo,sigma)
% WAVESEIS: Create a zero phase wavelet with the amplitude spectrum of a seismic trace
%
% [w,tw]=waveseis(s,t,fsmo,sigma)
% 
% s ... the seismic trace upon which the amplitude spectrum is modelled
% t ... time coordinate for s
% fsmo ... length of a convolutional smoother (HZ) applied to the amplitude
%       spectrum of s
% ************** default 10 Hz *************
% sigma ... standard deviation of a Gaussian window applied to the wavelet (time domain truncation).
% The wavelet will be truncated at +/- 3*sigma from t=0.
% ************** default 0.1 sec ***********
%
% w ... the wavelet
% tw ... time coordinate for the wavelet (same size as w)
