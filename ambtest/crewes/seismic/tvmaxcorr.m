function [cc,tcc]=tvmaxcorr(s1,s2,t,twin,tinc,maxlag,flag)
% TVMAXCORR: estimates time variant crosscorrelation of two signals
%
% [cc,tcc]=tvmaxcorr(s1,s2,t,twin,tinc,maxlag,flag)
% 
% The traces s1 and s2 are localized in time with a Gaussian window and then
% the crosscorrelation is calculated (see maxcorr).
% This process is repeated until all specified times are analyzed.
%
% s1= input trace to be analyzed
% s2= reference trace
% t= time coordinate vector for s1 and s2
% NOTE: s1,s2, and t must all be the same size
% twin= width (seconds) of the Gaussian window (standard deviation)
% tinc= temporal shift (seconds) between windows
% maxlag = maximum cc lag (seconds)
% ************* default = .4*twin ***********
% flag = if 1 then the bandwidth of signal is imposed on signal 2 before measurement
% ************* default = 0 *************
%
% cc= n-by-2 matrix of crosscorrelations values. Here the row index gives
%      the time and column 1 is the maximum correlation value while column
%      2 is the lag (in samples) at which the maximum occurs. Lags are
%      relative to the window center time.
% tcc= n-by-1 vector of window center times. These are the times of the cc values 
%
% NOTE: To stretch s1 to look like s2 use 
% [cc,tcc]=tvmaxcorr(s1,s2,t,twin,tinc,maxlag);
% delt=cc(:,2)*dt;
% tstretch=interp1(tcc,delt,t);
% s1p=stretcht(s1,t,-tstretch);
